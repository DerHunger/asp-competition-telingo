converts the hanoi tower problem of the ASP Competition ( https://www.mat.unical.it/aspcomp2013/HanoiTower ) to a more easy to understanding problem. The converted problem will be like the hanoi tower problem from the clingo guide ( https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/ )

Given (State 0):
steps(S) - number of steps to solve the problem
time(T) - time steps T=(1..S)
disk(D) - the first 4 disks are the pegs, everything above are the real disks
on0(D1, D2) - initial position of disk D1, it is on disk D2
ongoal(D1, D2) - final position of disk D1 is on disk D2
put(T, D1, D2) - put disk D1 on D2 in step T, solution atoms to be determined


Converted (State 1):
moves(S) - number of steps to solve the problem
time(T) - time steps T=(1..S)
peg(P) - all pegs
disk(D) - all disks
init_on(D,P) - initial position of disk D on peg P
goal_on(D,P) - final position of disk D on peg P
move(D,P,T) - move disk D to peg P in step T
